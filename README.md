## Built With

- JavaScript

## Possible Improvements

- Capitilization of first letter of hands
- Let the user know what to input in the prompt and let the user know how the game will work, e.g. best out of 5.
- Add a "how to play" section in the readme - usually a `how to use is needed to help readers of your project.
- optimize random value function
- check if the computer and player selected the same before going through the if statements and return the draw text
- add funtion for draw, win or lose instead of manually coding each time
